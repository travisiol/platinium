# PLATINIUM

**TRADE MEMES. STACK PLATINUM.**

A Robinhood Chain memecoin site: trading activity is designed to help fund
transparent platinum rewards/reserves through a mechanism that will be
disclosed and made independently verifiable once it's live. Built as a
fast, premium, mobile-first MVP — no complex DeFi mechanics, no fabricated
numbers.

## Status: pre-launch

The token ticker isn't finalized yet — `$PLATINIUM` in `src/lib/site-config.ts`
is a placeholder, change that one string once a real ticker is chosen. The
token has **not launched**. The Buy button shows "PLATINIUM Not Live Yet"
and every dashboard/transparency figure is either `0` or "Coming at
launch" until real values exist. See `.env.example` for the switches that
turn this on once the token, treasury, and platinum mechanism are real:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATINIUM_LIVE` — flips the Buy button to a real link once
  true
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATINIUM_TOKEN_ADDRESS` / `..._TREASURY_ADDRESS` — shown in
  the Transparency section once set
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATINIUM_PONS_URL` / `..._BUY_URL` — where Buy/PONS links
  route
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATINIUM_ASSET` — one-line description of the platinum
  mechanism, shown once decided

Live on-chain stats (platinum distributed, treasury, volume, holders) are
wired through `src/lib/data.ts` and intentionally return `0`/demo values
with a visible badge — swap in real reads (an indexer, subgraph, or direct
contract calls) when the treasury/reward mechanism exists. **Never replace
the demo badge with real-looking numbers that aren't backed by verifiable
on-chain data.**

## Important: verify before trusting any address in this repo

- **Robinhood Chain** network details (chain ID `4663`, RPC, explorer) in
  `src/lib/chain.ts` were gathered from public third-party sources
  (chainlist.org, trustswap.com) on 2026-08-27, not from
  `docs.robinhood.com/chain` directly (unreachable from the build
  environment). Re-confirm against the official docs before mainnet use.
- **PONS** contract/factory addresses are deliberately **not hardcoded**
  anywhere in this codebase. Research surfaced candidate addresses that
  could not be independently verified — do not trust them from any AI
  output, including this one. Confirm current addresses directly from
  PONS's own docs/app, then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PONS_FACTORY_ADDRESS`.
- Robinhood Chain reportedly has **no native gas token** — gas is paid in
  ETH, and there is no official Robinhood Chain airdrop token. Treat any
  token claiming otherwise as suspicious.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion +
wagmi v3 / viem for wallet connect and Robinhood Chain network handling.
No backend — this is a static-first marketing/product site with a small
client-side wallet layer.

## Structure

```
src/
  app/            routes, metadata, OG image, icon, robots/sitemap
  components/     Hero, PlatinumBar (CSS "3D" bar), StatsDashboard,
                  HowItWorks, PlatinumToast (+ showcase), Transparency,
                  Navbar, Footer, WalletConnect, BuyButton
  lib/
    chain.ts        Robinhood Chain viem chain definition
    wagmiConfig.ts   wagmi config (injected connector only)
    site-config.ts   site copy + launch/PONS config (env-driven)
    data.ts          demo dashboard stats + demo reward events
```

## Develop

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

## Build & deploy

```bash
npm run build   # verified passing
npm run start   # production server, for local smoke-testing
```

Deploys as a standard Next.js app on Vercel — connect the repo, set the
env vars from `.env.example` in the Vercel project settings, deploy.

## Wallet connect

Uses `wagmi`'s `injected()` connector (MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet
extension, etc. — no WalletConnect/project ID required, keeping deps
minimal for the MVP). Detects whether the connected wallet is on Robinhood
Chain and prompts "Switch to Robinhood Chain" if not. No private keys are
ever requested or stored.
